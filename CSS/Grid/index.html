        <div class="item-4">4. The minmax() function accepts 2 arguments: the first is the minimum size of the track and the second the maximum size. Alongside length values, the values can also be auto, which allows the track to grow/stretch based on the size of the content.

            In this example, the first row track is set to have a minimum height of 100px, but its maximum size of auto will allow the row track to grow it the content is taller than 100px.
            
            The first column track has a minimum size of auto, but its maximum size of 50% will prevent it from getting no wider than 50% of the grid container width.
